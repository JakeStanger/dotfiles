## Contribute

If you're providing code to add to the project please adhere to these coding practices to make it easier on everyone to collaborate efficiently.

### Spacing

Indent all code via tabs rather than spaces.

### Ordering

When including styles for a control keep them in the following order. The mantra is: "width before height, clockwise in position starting left." `X then Y, Left Top Right Bottom`

```text
// Styling
bgcolor
selectedbgcolor
selectedtextcolor
shadowtextcolor
textcolor

// Fonts
font-family
font-outerglow-color
font-outerglow-filtersize
font-outerglow-offset
font-size
font-style
font-weight

// Positioning
inset
inset-left
inset-top
inset-right
inset-bottom
minimum-width
minimum-height
padding-left
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom

// Content
image
```

Here is an example style:

```layout
TestStyle [!$OSX] {
	bgcolor=none
	selectedbgcolor=blue
	textcolor=red
	font-family=basefont
	font-size=15
	font-size=14 [$LINUX]
	font-weight=400
	image="graphics/test"
	inset="5 10 10 5" // Left, Top, Right, Bottom
	minimum-width=10

	render { }
	render_bg { }
}
```
